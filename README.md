### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Luke Po (he/him), and I am a 3rd year Computer Science and Physics major (with a minor in Informational Ethics) at Northeastern University.

#### Skills:
I am proficient in Java and Python with familiarity of many Object Oriented Design principles and different algorithms! I have experience with working with Git and with pair programming. I have also dabbled a bit into HTML and JavaScript.

#### Finished Projects:
##### Labyrinth Game:
Created in the fall of 2022 using the remote-proxy pattern from scratch, it is an adaptable Labyrinth game enabling for remote players to join a host server which may run the game and compute the winners. The program can portray the referee's side of the game via a GUI of each player's turn including their corresponding homes, player avatars, and goals. Pair programmed in python, the game allows for players to join and input their own strategies through JSON communication with the server, and will kick any player who misbehaves, either by trying to cheat or taking too long to respond to the server.

##### FreeCell Game:
Created in the summer of 2021 with the MVC design pattern from scratch, it is a flexible FreeCell text game using Java. It accommodates a diverse amount of game modes with the same general set of rules that apply to FreeCell, such as only allowing single-card moves, allowing multiple card moves, and having more than 4 open piles or foundation piles. The program illustrates the game via a text-view of the order of cards in each pile as the player inputs their specific moves into the console. The program code and project may be available upon request.
