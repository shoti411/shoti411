### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Luke Po (he/him), and I am a 2nd year Computer Science and Physics major (with a minor in Informational Ethics) at Northeastern University.

Skills:
I am proficient in Java and many Object Oriented Design principles and different algorithms! I have experience with working with Git and with pair programming. I have also dabbled a bit into HTML and JavaScript.

#### Finished Projects:
FreeCell Game:
Created in the summer of 2021 with the MVC design pattern from scratch, a flexible FreeCell text game using Java. It accommodates a diverse amount of game modes with the same general set of rules that apply to FreeCell, such as only allowing single-card moves, allowing multiple card moves, and having more than 4 open piles or foundation piles. The program illustrates the game via a text-view of the order of cards in each pile as the player inputs their specific moves into the console. The program code and project may be available upon request.
